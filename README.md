# GDP-Data-Extraction-and-Processing

This project is done by me as part of the "Python for Data Science, AI & Development" course offered by IBM Skills Network. The objective of this practice project is to apply the skills acquired throughout the course by extracting and processing GDP data.

Project objectives are,
 
Extract Data: Used web scraping techniques and request APIs to gather GDP data from a website.
Process Data: Utilized Pandas and Numpy libraries to clean, transform, and analyze the extracted data.
Data Conversion: Converted data types as necessary to ensure accurate analysis, such as converting GDP values to integers.
Analysis: Performed basic data analysis to gain insights from the GDP data.
Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used for data extraction and processing.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Used Numpy for numerical operations.
JupyterLab: An interactive development environment used to execute and document the project.
